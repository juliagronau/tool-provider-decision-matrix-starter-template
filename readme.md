# The Tool Provider Decision Matrix

Hi! Nice to see you on my GitHub profile.
In this repository you will find the **Tool Provider Decision Matrix Starter Template**.


## Why did I create this spreadsheet?

One of the workshops the students are working on during the Marketing Analytics Bootcamp at WBS CODING SCHOOL is to create a matrix that will help them choose the ideal tool and provider when putting together the MarTech stack for a given scenario.
To help them get started, I created this template.
